Why didn't they contribute back to the Python community and improve ``pip`` to overcome its deficiencies?\n",

      "They bundled a large portion of [NETLIB](http://netlib.org/liblist.html) into a single monolithic Python package (you might know this as [SciPy](http://scipy.org)), in effect creating a distribution-as-python-package to circumvent the fact that Python's distribution tools cannot manage these extra-Python dependencies in any meaningful way.\n",

He gave an excellent talk which specifically discusses pip and conda in the context of the \"unsolved problem\" of software distribution, and mentions the value of having multiple means of distribution tailored to the needs of specific users.\n",

      "As mentioned above, conda is already has a fully open toolchain, and is on a steady trend toward fully open packages (but is not entirely there just yet).\n",
      "An obvious direction is to push forward on community development and maintenance of the conda stack via conda-forge, perhaps eventually using it to replace conda's current default channel.\n",
      "\n",
      "As we push forward on this, I believe the conda and conda-forge community could benefit from imitating the clear and open governance model of the Python Packaging Authority.\n",
      "For example, PyPA has an open governance model with [explicit goals](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/future/), a clear [roadmap](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/roadmap/) for new developments and features, and well-defined channels of communication and discussion, and community oversight of the full pip/PyPI system from the ground up.\n",
      "\n",
      "With conda and conda-forge, on the other hand, the code (and soon all recipes) is open, but the model for governance and control of the system is far less explicit.\n",
      "Given the importance of conda particularly in the PyData community, it would benefit all of this to clarify this somehow \u2013 perhaps under the umbrella of the [NumFOCUS](http://www.numfocus.org/) organization.\n",
      "\n",
      "That being said, folks involved with conda-forge have told me that this is currently being addressed by the core team, including generation of governing documents, a code of conduct, and framework for enhancement proposals."

      "While the Python Package Index seems to have its governance in order, there are aspects of conda/conda-forge that I think would benefit it.\n",
      "For example, currently most Python packages can be loaded to conda-forge with just a few steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Post a public code release somewhere on the web (on github, bitbucket, PyPI, etc.)\n",

      "And that's it. Once the pull request is merged, the binary builds on Windows, OSX, and Linux are *automatically* created and loaded to the conda-forge channel.\n",

      "\n",

It is [definitely a possibility](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev/status/765583477597089792).\n"

      "\n",
      "I hope I've convinced you that conda and pip both have a role to play within the Python community. With that behind us, which should you use if you're starting out? The answer depends on what you want to do:\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you have an existing system Python installation and you want to install packages in or on it, use pip+virtualenv**. For example, perhaps you used ``apt`` or another system package manager to install Python, along with some packages linked to system tools that are not (yet) easily installable via conda or pip. Pip+virtualenv will allow you to install new Python packages and build environments on top of that existing distribution, and you should be able to rely on your system package manager for any difficult-to-install dependencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you want to flexibly manage a multi-language software stack and don't mind using an isolated environment, use conda**. Conda's multi-language dependency management and cross-platform binary installations can do things in this situation that pip cannot do.\n",
      "A huge benefit is that for most packages, the result will be immediately compatible with multiple operating systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "**If you want to install Python packages within an Isolated environment, pip+virtualenv and conda+conda-env are mostly interchangeable**. This is the overlap region where both tools shine in their own way. That being said, I tend to prefer conda in this situation: Conda's uniform, cross-platform, full-stack management of multiple parallel Python environments with robust dependency management has proven to be an *incredible* time-saver in my research, my teaching, and my software development work.\n",
      "Additionally, I find that my needs and the needs of my colleagues more often stray into areas of conda's strengths (management of non-Python tools and dependencies) than into areas of pip's strengths (environment-agnostic Python package management).\n",
      "\n",
      "As an example, years ago I spent nearly a quarter with a colleague trying to install the complicated (non-Python) software stack that powers the [megaman package](https://github.com/mmp2/megaman), which we were developing together.\n",
      "The result of all our efforts was a single non-reproducible working stack on a single machine.\n",
      "Then conda-forge was introduced. We went through the process again, this time creating a [conda recipe](https://github.com/conda-forge/staged-recipes/pull/277/files), from which a [conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/megaman-feedstock) was built.\n",
      "We now have a cross-platform solution that will install a working version of the package and its dependencies with a single command, in seconds, on nearly any computer.\n",
      "If there is a way to build and distribute software with that kind of dependency graph seamlessly with pip+PyPI, I haven't seen it."
